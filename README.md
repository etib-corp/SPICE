# SPICE for Samoussa Processing & Intermediate Code Engine

## Introduction

With SPICE you can create your own language. This is done by creating a parser configuration file.
This configuration file respects our own syntax and is used to define the syntax of your language.

## Syntax

To learn how to create a parser configuration file, you can read the [Parser Configuration](ParserConfiguration.md) documentation.

## Credits

All this project is maintained by Etib.

Our thanks to Raphael for his help and his advices.
Here is his [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raph-turpin/), [GitHub](https://github.com/Agakitsune) and his [E-mail](mailto:raphael.turpin@epitech.eu)

We inspired ourselves from the [Parsec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec) library for Haskell (We implemented our own parsec).
