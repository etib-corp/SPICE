# About GLADOS


## What is GLADOS?

The description on the MkDocs site is:

> Project documentation with Markdown.

The objective of this project is to create a custom programming language using Haskell. The implementation will be divided into several mandatory steps, each designed to progressively guide you through increasing levels of difficulty. With a structured approach, the project aims to ensure a smooth learning experience. And as a lighthearted touch, participants are promised cake and grief counseling upon completion of the challenge.

<!-- ## Do I need to know Python?

MkDocs is built in Python (like Sphinx), but you don't have to write Python code. If you set up a [Deploy](deploy) flow right, you don't even have to set it up locally, though then you can't preview. -->
